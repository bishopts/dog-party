# Dog Party

## Task

It’s a dog party! As a frontend developer, you’re going to need to be able to accurately build out the UI (user interface) for websites based on comps provided by a designer. For your first project, you’ll build a 1-page static site to practice writing well structured, semantic HTML with clean, precise CSS, as well as take a first crack at adding some user interaction with Javascript and the DOM.

Similar to what you might be asked to do on the job, we’ve given you a comp with a set of technical specs to go along with it and your challenge is to build it.
